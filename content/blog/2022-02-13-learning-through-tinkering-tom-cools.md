Our March Brighton JUG will take place on Tuesday 15th March at 5pm GMT. We will be opening the zoom just before 5pm for people to gather and chat.

Our first speaker will be Tom Cools who will be talking about Learning Through Tinkering

Do you also feel like it’s hard to keep up with all the new tools and frameworks coming your way? You are not alone! By choosing IT, you are choosing to learn for the rest of your life… not an easy task.

In this session we’ll look into some concepts that will help you get the most out of your efforts to learn new shiny stuff!

We’ll go over a couple of example projects and give you some tools to keep learning without being overwhelmed by the flood of new technologies.
