We are very excited to welcome **Dan Conn.** He will be giving a talk on **Today's Special: Apache Tika Masala!**

Apache Tika is an awesome open-source tool which can be used for search indexing, sentiment analysis, detecting the true 
mime type of a file, or language detection. But Tika can also add some spice to a workflow by helping to highlight threats.

This talk will show Tikaâ€™s general use cases and how developers can benefit from its use, but also how it can be used 
for finding threats in file metadata or content, which may benefit more experienced developers working in security realms.
