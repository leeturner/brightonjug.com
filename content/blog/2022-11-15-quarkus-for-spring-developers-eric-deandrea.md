**Quarkus for Spring Developers with Eric Deandrea**

We are very excited to welcome Eric Deandrea. He will be giving a talk on Quarkus for Spring Developers:

In this session, I will show concepts and conventions familiar to Spring developers and how those same concepts and conventions can be implemented in Quarkus, all while highlighting similarities and differences between them. Additionally, I will show similarities and differences in how testing is done, highlighting Quarkus Dev Services.

I will introduce an existing Spring application with a full test suite, then using a test-driven-development approach with Quarkus Dev Services & Continuous testing, quickly convert it to Quarkus.
