**Getting started cloud natively, with Java with Mark Sailes**

We are very excited to welcome Mark Sailes. He will be giving a talk on Getting started cloud natively, with Java:

In this talk we will use the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to deploy Java backends for various event driven applications. We'll use the Micronaut framework to create a synchronous REST API, and an asynchronous event worker.

We'll also talk a little about GraalVM native-image and why it's important for AWS Lambda
