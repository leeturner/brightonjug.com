Out first ever Brighton JUG will take place on Tuesday 18th January at 5 pm GMT.

Our first speaker will be [Helen Scott](https://www.helenjoscott.com) who is a Keynote Storyteller at MongoDB. Helen will be talking to us about how Writing Code is Easy, Being a Great Developer is Hard:

**tldr; Everything I wish I’d learned about being a developer at University.**

We learn to write code at university, bootcamp, or we teach ourselves. Then, after months/years, we launch ourselves at our development careers and also, inadvertently launch ourselves at a whole bunch of other skills, that we might not have even realised we needed. These skills are rarely taught on traditional routes, but it’s these skills, when combined with writing code, that make you a great developer.
